The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin their school after they return from overseas.

If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

The school will provide support in the following areas to ease your child's  return:

*   **Administrative:** Renewal of LOA, returning arrangements, updates on important dates for admissions exercises, etc.
*   **Academic:** Major test and examination papers with answers, where appropriate, on a regular basis, and access to Student Learning Space (SLS) portal that enables your child to keep up-to-date with our national curriculum.
*   **Relationship:** Developments in the school and local education scene.  
      
<h6><u>Eligibility</u></h6>
LOA applies to all SC and PR children in primary school, secondary school, junior colleges and Millennia Institute.

To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all 3 of the following criteria:

*   An SC or PR.
*   Presently studying in a Singapore school.
*   Accompanying you on an overseas posting with the intention of rejoining their school after returning to Singapore. 

Your child also qualifies for LOA if they are already registered for Primary 1 (P1) but will be overseas at the start of the year.  

<h6><u>Fees</u></h6>
Schools will charge an annual nominal fee for a child on LOA. The amount will be determined by individual schools.

At the end of each year, you will need to decide whether to renew the LOA for another year. Your child’s LOA status will expire if you choose not to renew.

### Registration Phases for Academic Year of 2026

<h4><u>OVERVIEW OF PHASES  </u></h4><br>
<i><u>For Singapore Citizen (SC) and Permanent Resident (PR) Children</u></i>

Parents of <b>Singapore Citizen (SC) and Permanent Resident (PR)</b> children can register through the [P1 Registration Portal](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/how-to-register) during Phase 1 to Phase 2C Supplementary.

On the portal, you can:
<ul>
<li>View your child’s eligible registration phases and schools from 9am on Tuesday, 1 July 2025.</li>
<li>Register your child during their eligible phases, from Phase 1 to 2C Supplementary.</li>
<li>Check registration outcome on results announcement days. (You will also be notified of the results through SMS.)</li></ul>

You need a valid Singpass with 2-Factor Authentication (Singpass2FA) to access the P1 Registration Portal.

Only one parent is required to register. In the Registration Portal, you are required to declare that you have sought consent from the other parent to register your child for P1.

In the P1 Registration Portal, you will be directed to register via an online form if:
<ul>
<li>You have a child due for P1 registration, whose name is not shown in the portal.</li>
	<li>Your child is eligible for a phase or school that is not reflected in the portal.</li></ul>

You may need to submit supporting documents during registration. Schools may also contact you for clarification or additional documents.

<i><u>For International Students</u></i>

<b>International students</b> must register through a 2-step process prior to registration in Phase 3. <br><br>
<b><u>Step 1:</u></b> Submit an online ‘indication of interest' form via the MOE P1 website from <b>9am on Tuesday, 27 May 2025 to 4.30pm on Monday, 2 June 2025.</b> 
<br><br>
<b><u>Step 2: </u></b> MOE will notify IS applicants who have indicated their interest via email in October 2025, as to whether their child can be offered a P1 place in a primary school. If a place is offered, the parent of the child will be informed of how to register with the designated school.

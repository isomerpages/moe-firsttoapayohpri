#### Registration Phases for Academic Year of 2023

<h5><u>OVERVIEW OF PHASES  </u></h5>

In line with the measures announced by the Government to further enhance safe distancing measures and ensure minimal contact among the public, there will be **no in-person registration** at schools for the 2022 P1 registration. You may register your child online in a phase as long as you fulfil at least one of the requirements for that phase.

You can only register your child in one school at any phase. Multiple applications will **not** be accepted. If you have submitted your online application and wish to make an amendment during the same phase, you may submit a new application form within the same phase. In these situations, MOE will take your **latest** online application submitted during the stipulated registration period of the same registration phase.

If you have secured a P1 place for your child in a previous registration phase, you will need to [withdraw your place](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/how-to-register?toggle-id=documents-for-withdrawal-from-school) from the school before registering in another school. **Unless you have withdrawn your place, MOE will not process any further online applications made for your child and your child will remain in the school that your child had earlier secured a place at.** You are to ensure that the child has been successfully withdrawn before submitting another online application.

<b><u>Note:</u></b>

*   P1 registration is not first-come, first-served. There is no special priority given to early registrants, whether through P1-IS or online form registration.

*   If you require assistance with your online registration, please refer to the guide or contact us via email ([ftpps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:ftpps@moe.edu.sg)) or telephone (6256 7822). Do expect delays as we may experience higher than normal call and email volumes during P1 Registration days. We will contact you in due course upon receipt of your email.

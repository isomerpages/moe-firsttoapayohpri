<br><strong>Values Define Us<br></strong>As we reflect on 2024, it has been
a year filled with growth, challenges and valuable lessons. Throughout,
we lived out our school’s core values—responsibility, respect, love, integrity
and perseverance—both individually and as a community.</p>
<p>Perseverance was key as we faced and overcame challenges by giving our
best. We embodied respect, treating those around us with kindness. We embraced
responsibility with student leaders stepping up proactively. Integrity
guided us in owning our mistakes with honesty while love was shown through
our care and support for one another.</p>
<p>I am proud of how we have grown, not only as students but as individuals
guided by these values. Let’s carry them forward in all we do.</p>

<p><strong>Guided by Values<br></strong>The values taught by my teachers
and supported by my friends have shaped who I am today. Since being elected
as a Prefect in P3, I aspired to be like the senior prefects—role models
who led by example. This inspired me to live by our core values and strive
for self-improvement.</p>
<p>Through challenges, I learned to respect others' ideas. When mistakes
were made, I saw them as opportunities to grow. My leadership journey has
always been supported by the encouragement of friends, teachers and parents,
who believed in me and pushed me to do my best.</p>
<p>As I prepare to graduate, I will always cherish the impact they had on
me and carry these lessons into the future.</p>

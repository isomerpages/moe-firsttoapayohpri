#### School Procedures


##### Flag-Raising Ceremony

All students are expected to be seated at the Parade Square or hall by 7.15am and the ceremony will start promptly at 7.25 am. Kindly note that the attendance at the flag-raising and pledge-taking ceremony is compulsory for all students.

  

##### Leaving school early

Parents/ guardians must obtain permission from the Principal, Vice-Principal or teachers if they wish to take their children home because of sickness or other urgent matters.
<br>
Parents/ guardians must sign in the Student Leaving School Early’ book at the security guard post.

  

##### Communication

Parents may communicate with the teachers regarding the child’s learning or behaviour through this handbook.

  

#### School Safety Guidelines


To ensure the safety and security of all our students and staff, all visitors to the school would be required to present their identity card in exchange for a visitor’s pass at the security post before proceeding to the General Office.
<br>

Please note that the area just outside the main entrance of the school is a non-stopping/ non-waiting area. In view of the safety of our students and in compliance to LTA traffic ruling, vehicles are prohibited to make U-turns in front of the school gate. Parents may drive into the school to drop off their children before 7.30am. After 7.30 am, parents may have their children alight either before the yellow box outside the main gate or near the canteen gate.
<br>

Teachers are stationed at the pedestrian crossing just outside the school to help ensure the safety of our students. We educate our students to observe road safety regulations at all times and seek the support and co-operation of parents in the use of the pedestrian crossing when walking with their children to and from school.

  

#### THE DESIRED OUTCOMES OF EDUCATION


Our students will become

*   a confident person who has a strong sense of right and wrong, is adaptable and resilient, knows himself, is discerning in judgment, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively;
*   a self-directed learner who takes responsibility for his own learning, who questions, reflects and perseveres in the pursuit of learning;
*   an active contributor who is able to work effectively in teams, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks, is innovative and strives for excellence; and,
*   a concerned citizen who is rooted to Singapore, has a strong civic consciousness, is informed, and takes an active role in bettering the lives of others around him.

Please note that the area just outside the main entrance of the school is a non-stopping/ non-waiting area.

Parents may drive into the school to drop off their children before 7.30am.

Teachers are stationed at the pedestrian crossing just outside the school to help ensure the safety of our students. We educate our students to observe road safety regulations at all times and seek the support and co-operation of parents in the use of the pedestrian crossing when walking with their children to and from school.

<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>As the newly appointed principal for this established school, I too share
in the anticipation and enthusiasm that comes with a fresh start. Before
my posting to this school, I had the honour of serving as a school principal
at both Eunos Primary School (2009 to 2016) and Geylang Methodist Primary
School (2016 to 2023). I began my teaching career in 1988 at Si Ling Secondary
School, where I taught English and English Literature. Over the years,
I gradually took on more responsibilities. The experiences gained from
working alongside many dedicated educators, engaging with students of diverse
profiles, and collaborating with supportive parents have been most helpful.
I look forward to contributing and learning more from our staff and all
of you in our shared pursuit of educational excellence here at First Toa
Payoh Primary School (FTPPS).</p>
<p>My predecessor, Mr Chua Choon Guan, had over the years, laid a very strong
foundation for us to build upon, A true leader, he consistently prioritized
the interests of both staff and students in every decision and action.
Mr Chua led by example, showcasing an unyielding work ethic and a passion
for fostering a positive and enriching educational environment. His tireless
efforts and genuine concern for the well-being and growth of the school
community left an indelible mark, setting a high standard of excellence
for us to uphold and build upon. We are grateful for Mr Chua's invaluable
contributions and appreciate the legacy of integrity and selfless dedication
he leaves behind as we wish him a very happy and fulfilling retirement.
I am sure he will be fondly remembered by the staff and the students. Moving
forward, we will continue to foster innovative teaching and learning practices,
ensuring that each child remains at the centre of our purpose. We will
continue the strong partnership we have with the parents, partners, and
stakeholders, striving to bring out the best in every child and empowering
them to be future-ready.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting many of you soon and learning more about how,
together, we can enrich your child’s school experiences with us. Your strong
support and collaboration are key elements for your child’s success.</p>
<p>Mrs Jennifer Choy
<br>Principal</p>

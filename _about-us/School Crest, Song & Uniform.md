#### SCHOOL CREST

<img src="/images/Main/Revised_School_Crest_on_clear_background__Full_Colour_.png" style="width:60%;">

The acronym of the school’s name “FTPPS” is strategically positioned to point at a compass. This symbolic representation signifies the school’s commitment to guide, mould and nurture our students to become better individuals, making responsible choices as they navigate life’s challenges. 

At its core is a compass embraced by the school motto which serves as a beacon, guiding students towards a future where they can positively impact and contribute to the nation as concerned and useful citizens. 

The colour yellow represents the bright, promising future ahead for the students in our care.
The colour blue symbolises calmness and stability, mirroring the supportive environment we provide to nurture students with diverse needs and talents. We show our students every concern for their well-being, giving them every support and encouragement to achieve their personal best.

#### School Uniform

One would have to look closely at the fabric of the school uniform to notice this interesting fact: the numeral 1 is a motif of the fabric.  

We have the unique distinction of being the first primary school serving the Toa Payoh residents since 1968.

As our students proudly wear this mark of distinction, we would like them to aspire to be No. 1 in character and in the many areas of their development.

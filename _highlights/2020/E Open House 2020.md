##### A WARM WELCOME TO OUR
### E - OPEN HOUSE 2020
##### FIRST TOA PAYOH PRIMARY SCHOOL

*A caring and creative learning community in the pursuit of excellence*

------------------------------------------

Dear Parents and Guardians

We hope you and your family are keeping well. COVID-19 has brought tremendous change to all of us and we find ourselves in uncharted waters and managing many challenges.

With the implementation of safe management measures in schools, we regret that at First Toa Payoh Primary School (FTPPS), we are unable to host the physical Open House this year that we had previously done for the many K2 students in our neighbouring kindergartens. 

We know that choosing a suitable primary school for your child is of paramount importance. The primary school years are an important phase of your child’s education as they lay the foundation for their learning.

Hence, we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for visiting FTPPS E-Open House to experience the school’s distinctive programmes, conducive learning environment and nurturing culture.  At FTPPS, we strive to provide an array of learning experiences for every student to discover his/her interests and talents, as well as unleash his/her potential in diverse domains. Through developing our students holistically, we aspire to nurture them to be well-rounded, healthy individuals of sound character and values.  In FTPPS, Every Child Matters!

If you have any enquiries pertaining to FTPPS or the P1 Registration Exercise, please contact us at [ftpps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:ftpps@moe.edu.sg).  We will be glad to get in touch with you.

Thank you.

Mr Chua Choon Guan
<br>
Principal

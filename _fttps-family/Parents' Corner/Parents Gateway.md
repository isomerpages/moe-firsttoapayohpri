<h4>What is Parents Gateway?</h4>

Developed by the Ministry of Education and GovTech, Parents Gateway is a one-stop portal that strengthens school-home partnership to support our children in their education journey. Parents Gateway allows parents to engage closely with schools receive information and perform a range of administrative functions including giving consent for school trips.

We strongly encourage you to download the free Parents Gateway Mobile App on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process.

From April 2019 onward, parents will receive all school notifications and consent forms via the mobile app.

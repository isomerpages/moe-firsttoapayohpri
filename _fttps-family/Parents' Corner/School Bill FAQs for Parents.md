<h4><u>General </u></h4>

**1. What is School Bill?**
<br>
Similar to MOE Bill for school and miscellaneous fees, parents will receive a School Bill for enrichment programmes and school charges prepared by the school. School Bill is only issued by government or government-aided schools.

**2. What are the bill charges about?**
<br>
The School Bill comprises enrichment programme and/or school charges.

**3. How often will I receive a School Bill?**
<br>
You will receive a School Bill whenever there are new enrichment programmes and school charges, or when there are adjustments to previous bills (e.g. refunds arising from programme cancellation).

**4. Why am I receiving more than one School Bill for my child?**
<br>
School Bill is school-specific. Your child may have more than one School Bill if there are arrears from his previous school, in addition to charges from his current school.

<h4><u>Notification and Parental Consent</u></h4>

**5. What items will I be billed for?**
<br>
You will only be billed for enrichment programmes which you have given consent for your child’s participation.

**6. Will I be notified if there are going to be changes to the bill amount?**
<br> 
Your school will update you on all bill adjustments (if any).

<h4><u>Payment</u></h4>

**7. How can I pay for the School Bill?**
<br>
<u><em>For Singaporean students:</em></u>
<br>
You can authorise the Edusave Enrichment Programme Standing Order (EPSO) for the school to make withdrawals from your child’s/ward’s Edusave account to pay for enrichment programme charges. If your child’s Edusave funds are insufficient, or if you choose not to authorise the EPSO, cash payment can be made via the following channels:

*   SAM Mobile (Available on Apple App Store and Google Play)
*   SAM Web (http://www.mysam.sg/)
*   SAM Kiosk 
*   Cash/Cheque (to be given to the school)
*   GIRO Option

Edusave cannot be used for school charges, and so must be paid for using the cash channels above.

<u><em>For non-Singaporean students:</em></u>
<br>
Payment can be made via the following channels:

*   SAM Mobile (Available on Apple App Store and Google Play)
*   SAM Web ([www.mysam.sg](www.mysam.sg))
*   SAM Kiosk 
*   Cash/Cheque (to be given to the school)
*   GIRO Option

**8. What happens if I do not pay the School Bill by the “pay by date” (shown in bottom right corner of the bill)?**
<br>
If the “amount payable” on your bill is not scheduled for GIRO deduction, and is not paid in cash/cheque by the “pay by date” (i.e. the 6th of the next month), then this amount will be carried forward as an outstanding balance to the next month’s bill.

<h4><u>Credit Balances</u></h4>

**9. What do I when there is a credit balance on my child’s school bill?**
<br>
We encourage you to leave the credit balance on your child’s school bill. This will be used to offset any subsequent school charges and/or new enrichment programme co-payment amounts. Otherwise, you may approach your school directly to seek a refund.

**10. How will I get a refund of the credit balance if my child has graduated or left the school?**
<br>
Credit balances will be refunded at the end of the year for all graduating students. If your child leaves the school before graduation, an ad-hoc refund will be done for your child.

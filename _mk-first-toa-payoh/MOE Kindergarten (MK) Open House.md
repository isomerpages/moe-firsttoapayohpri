<h3><strong>ON TO A STRONG START!</strong></h3><p>Dear Parents,</p><p>Are you looking for a quality and affordable kindergarten programme for your preschool child?</p><p>At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are curious, active and competent learners. We nurture children holistically, so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p><p>Our curriculum is developed by MOE’s curriculum specialists and trained educators with knowledge and experience in early childhood education and who are familiar with the primary school curriculum. Your child will embark on an exciting learning journey through our two flagship programmes – the HI-Light Programme and the Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language. These programmes focus on the holistic development of children and seek to ignite the joy of learning in them.</p><p>Should you require a full-day service for your child, we also offer Kindergarten Care (KCare) at all MKs. If you register, your child will be in KCare before and after the MK session, providing a full-day programme for your child within the same premises.</p><p>We will be holding our Open House for parents to tour the learning environment and speak to the MK educators in person. We warmly welcome you and your child to our <strong>2024 MOE Kindergarten Open House at First Toa Payoh Primary School </strong>to find out why MK is the quality preschool choice and how we ignite joy of learning in our children!</p><p>Open House at<strong> MOE Kindergarten @ First Toa Payoh (MK@FY) </strong>will be held on Saturday, <strong>3 February 2024 , 8.30 am to 12.30 pm.</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://go.gov.sg/mkoh2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sign up</a></strong> for the Open House.

### ON TO A STRONG START!
<br>
Dear Parents,

Are you looking for a quality and affordable kindergarten programme for your pre-school child?

At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are curious, active and competent learners. We nurture children holistically, so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.

Our curriculum is developed by MOE’s curriculum specialists and trained educators with knowledge and experience in early childhood education and who are familiar with the primary school curriculum. Your child will embark on an exciting learning journey through our two flagship programmes – the HI-Light Programme and the Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language. These programmes focus on the holistic development of children and seek to ignite the joy of learning in them.

Should you require a full-day service for your child, we also offer Kindergarten Care (KCare) at all MKs. If you register, your child will be in KCare before and after the MK session, providing a full-day programme for your child within the same premises.

For the first time in three years, our MKs will be holding a physical Open House for parents to tour the learning environment and speak to the MK educators in person. We warmly welcome you and your child to [sign up](https://go.gov.sg/mkopenhouse2023pmk) for the **2023 MOE Kindergarten Open House on 18 February 2023 from 9.00am to 1.00pm**, to find out why MK is the quality preschool choice and how we ignite joy of learning in our children!

**Open House at MK@First Toa Payoh (MK@FY)** will be held on **18 Feb 2023, 9.00am to 1.00pm**.

[Sign up](https://go.gov.sg/mkopenhouse2023pmk) for the Open House. We look forward to seeing you!

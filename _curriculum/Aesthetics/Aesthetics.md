#### 2018 Programmes

##### FIRST Clicks - Literacy Through Photography (LTP)

As part of the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP), all students from P1 to P6 participate in the Literacy Through Photography (LTP) programme where they learn to articulate their thoughts and inspirations through photography, reflections and jounals. Students are exposed to different photography tools ranging from the basic acrylic viewfinder, iPad, paper camera, compact camera to the professional DSLR cameras, over a 6-year progressive journey.

The LTP allows the students to develop attributes of a confident person, concerned citizen and self-directed learner as they embark on learning individually and in close collaboration with their schoolmates. In the course of learning and quest for the perfect shot, students learn perseverance and patience. Collaborating with one another also exposes them to different perspectives.

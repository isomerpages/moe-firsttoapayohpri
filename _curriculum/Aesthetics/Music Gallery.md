The learning objectives, outcomes and approaches of the Music programme are closely aligned with that of the MOE Music Syllabus.<br><br>
The students are provided with various opportunities to demonstrate what they have learned, such as performing together as a group during class, recess recitals, and school-wide events.<br><br>

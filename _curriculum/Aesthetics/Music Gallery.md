		<li> Acquiring and applying musical skills, knowledge and understanding through Listening, Creating and Performing</li>
		<li>Developing abilities for creative expression and communication</li>
		<li>Developing an understanding and appreciation of music in local and global cultures</li>
		<li>Cultivating a life-long enjoyment and involvement in music.</li>
	</ol>

#### Learning Approach

The Tamil  Language Department aims to achieve quality results through quality teaching and learning. We inculcate co-operative learning skills, ICT and interactive tools in our classroom teaching. We hope to achieve academic excellence in a non-threatening learning environment.

#### Signature Programmes

##### Learning Journey to Little India Pongal Festival

Pupils of P4 and P5 went to Little India to participate in the Pongal Festivities. It was an opportunity not be missed as they had a chance to see cows and goats at arms-length. They also took part in all the hands-on sessions like saree/vetti tying, Kolam drawing, cooking of pongal rice and village dancing.

Pupils of P4 and P5 went to Little India to participate in the Pongal Festivities. It was an opportunity not be missed as they had a chance to see cows and goats at arms-length. They also took part in all the hands-on sessions like saree/vetti tying, Kolam drawing, cooking of pongal rice and village dancing.

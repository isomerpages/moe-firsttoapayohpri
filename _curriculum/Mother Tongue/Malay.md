<h4><b> Learning Approach</b></h4>

The Malay Language Department aims to achieve quality results through quality teaching and learning.  

*   We inculcate co-operative learning skills in our classroom teaching.
*   We hope to achieve academic excellence in a non-threatening learning environment.

<h4><b> Signature Programmes</b></h4>
<h5><b> Conversational Chinese/ Malay Programme (CCM)  </b></h5>

The CCM Programme is introduced to P3 and P4 students. The aims of introducing CCM programme are two-fold:

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li> to strengthen social cohesion among the races in Singapore; and</li>
	<li> to enable Singaporeans to have some grounding in the language so that they could more easily  pick up the language should they need it for economic or other reasons in adult life.</li>
	</ol>
<h5><b>Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight (MTLFN) and Language &amp; Cultural Camps</b></h5>

The MTL Fortnight activities and Language &amp; Cultural Camps provide enriching and meaningful learning experiences for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as ‘a living language’. The activities provide authentic opportunities for students to use MTL and experience the culture. By providing an immersive environment for students to learn and use MTL in a more in-depth manner, students are able to better appreciate their respective mother tongue languages and cultures.

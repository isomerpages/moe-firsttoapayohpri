<p>In the teaching and learning of mathematics, the school believes in building
a strong foundation in the mathematical concepts in our students. We guide
our students in the acquisition of mathematical concepts and skills through
activity-based lessons using the&nbsp;<strong>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A)</strong>&nbsp;approach.
Students are given concrete experiences to help them develop a sense of
numbers, make connections and subsequently become better problem-solvers.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:70%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/ma6.jpg">
</div>
<p>We believe that students discover, reason and communicate their thinking
as they work in collaboration with their peers. Through&nbsp;<strong>collaborative learning</strong>,
students build confidence in problem-solving, foster an interest towards
learning mathematics and importantly, acquire deeper knowledge in mathematics.</p>
<p>Targeted at the lower primary levels,&nbsp;<strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</strong>&nbsp;is
an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to students
who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the
Primary 1 Mathematics curriculum. Identified students will be supported
by specially trained LSM Teachers through activity-based lessons focusing
on small successes to build on their motivation.</p>
<p>For the middle primary levels, the&nbsp;<strong>Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)</strong>&nbsp;programme
is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support low progress learners
students using intervention strategies and models that are guided by research
to tackle the 4 key issues: learning gaps, language, motivation and memory.
The lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement,
Mastery and Consolidation.</p>

<h6><strong>MATHS FUN DAY</strong></h6>
<p><em>Building Foundations for Joyful Learning</em>
<br>
<br>In the first week of Term 2, Term 3, and Term 4, selected P3 and P4 prefects
took on the role of facilitators for specially designed mathematics-based
games, exclusively crafted for the P1 students. These games were strategically
co-created by the prefects and the teachers to help the P1 students reinforce
concepts learned in the previous term and, more importantly, to cultivate
a joyful approach to learning.
<br>
<br>The game stations were proposed and developed by the prefects, providing
an engaging platform for P1 students to revise essential mathematical concepts.
The aim was to make learning enjoyable while reinforcing their understanding.
<br>
<br>In their post-activity reflection forms, the prefects shared that this
experience taught them valuable lessons in patience, particularly when
explaining the rules before the games commenced. They expressed a deep
sense of satisfaction in successfully guiding their younger peers through
activities centred around addition and subtraction.
<br>
<br>This initiative not only served as an educational platform but also fostered
a sense of mentorship and camaraderie among students of different levels.

<p>The exploration didn't stop there; students eagerly gathered around balance
scales and weighing scales to compare the masses of different objects,
particularly various fruits. This practical application allowed them to
witness firsthand how the concept of mass is applied in real-world scenarios,
fostering a more intuitive understanding.
<br>
<br>To further solidify their learning, everyday examples were ingeniously
incorporated. Students had the opportunity to develop a sense of how heavy
1 kg or 1 g feels by interacting with common household items. Packets of
sugar, flour, rice, paper, and even a rubber band served as tangible examples,
connecting theoretical knowledge with the tangible weight of everyday objects.
<br>
<br>The Mass Fun Day not only made learning about mass an exciting adventure
but also laid the groundwork for a more profound comprehension of this
fundamental scientific concept. Through practical engagement and real-world

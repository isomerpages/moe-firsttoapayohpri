##### Learning Approach

In the teaching and learning of mathematics, the school believes in building a strong foundation in the mathematical concepts in our students. We guide our students in the acquisition of mathematical concepts and skills through activity-based lessons using the&nbsp;**Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A)**&nbsp;approach. Students are given concrete experiences to help them develop a sense of numbers, make connections and subsequently become better problem-solvers.

We believe that students discover, reason and communicate their thinking as they work in collaboration with their peers. Through&nbsp;**collaborative learning**, students build confidence in problem-solving, foster an interest towards learning mathematics and importantly, acquire deeper knowledge in mathematics.

Targeted at the lower primary levels,&nbsp;**Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)**&nbsp;is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 Mathematics curriculum. Identified students will be supported by specially trained LSM Teachers through activity-based lessons focusing on small successes to build on their motivation.

For the middle primary levels, the&nbsp;**Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**&nbsp;programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support low progress learners students using intervention strategies and models that are guided by research to tackle the 4 key issues: learning gaps, language, motivation and memory. The lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.

	<h5><a id="home">Use of Games in Mathematics (P1 to P6)</a></h5>
	
Through the use of games, we strive to nurture students’ creative and inventive thinking. Games provide the opportunity for students to apply their reasoning in a fun and inviting environment, where learning through engagement is promoted.&nbsp;

Embedding games into the concrete-pictorial-abstract approach in Mathematics is purposeful, as students actively reinforce and hone their factual fluency and mathematical concepts. Also, games call for the need for our students to think out of the box as they devise creative and innovative solutions in the gameplay. Some examples of the games used during curriculum time are listed below.

<h6><b>MATHS FUN DAY</b></h6>
<i>Building Foundations for Joyful Learning</i><br><br>
In the first week of Term 2, Term 3, and Term 4, selected P3 and P4 prefects took on the role of facilitators for specially designed mathematics-based games, exclusively crafted for the P1 students. These games were strategically co-created by the prefects and the teachers to help the P1 students reinforce concepts learned in the previous term and, more importantly, to cultivate a joyful approach to learning.<br><br>
The game stations were proposed and developed by the prefects, providing an engaging platform for P1 students to revise essential mathematical concepts. The aim was to make learning enjoyable while reinforcing their understanding.<br><br>
In their post-activity reflection forms, the prefects shared that this experience taught them valuable lessons in patience, particularly when explaining the rules before the games commenced. They expressed a deep sense of satisfaction in successfully guiding their younger peers through activities centred around addition and subtraction.<br><br>
This initiative not only served as an educational platform but also fostered a sense of mentorship and camaraderie among students of different levels.<br><br>

<h6><b>MASS FUN DAY</b></h6>
<i>A Hands-on Learning Experience</i><br><br>
In an exploration of the world of Mass, our P2 students engaged in a Mass Fun Day that not only made learning tangible but also left a lasting impression on their understanding of this fundamental concept.<br><br>
One of the key highlights of the day was the opportunity for students to work collaboratively in groups, delving into hands-on experiences in measuring mass. Each group embarked on the exciting journey of measuring the mass of various objects. This interactive activity not only honed their practical skills but also encouraged them to articulate their choices of units: grams or kilograms, providing a deeper insight into the measurement process.

The exploration didn't stop there; students eagerly gathered around balance scales and weighing scales to compare the masses of different objects, particularly various fruits. This practical application allowed them to witness firsthand how the concept of mass is applied in real-world scenarios, fostering a more intuitive understanding.<br><br>
To further solidify their learning, everyday examples were ingeniously incorporated. Students had the opportunity to develop a sense of how heavy    1 kg or 1 g feels by interacting with common household items. Packets of sugar, flour, rice, paper, and even a rubber band served as tangible examples, connecting theoretical knowledge with the tangible weight of everyday objects.<br><br>
The Mass Fun Day not only made learning about mass an exciting adventure but also laid the groundwork for a more profound comprehension of this fundamental scientific concept. Through practical engagement and real-world examples, students not only measured mass but also measured the fun and excitement in their learning journey.

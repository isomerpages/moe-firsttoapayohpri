##### Learning Approach

In the teaching and learning of mathematics, the school believes in building a strong foundation in the mathematical concepts in our students. We guide our students in the acquisition of mathematical concepts and skills through activity-based lessons using the **Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A)** approach. Students are given concrete experiences to help them develop a sense of numbers, make connections and subsequently become better problem-solvers.

We believe that students discover, reason and communicate their thinking as they work in collaboration with their peers. Through **collaborative learning**, students build confidence in problem-solving, foster an interest towards learning mathematics and importantly, acquire deeper knowledge in mathematics.

Targeted at the lower primary levels, **Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)** is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 Mathematics curriculum. Identified students will be supported by specially trained LSM Teachers through activity-based lessons focusing on small successes to build on their motivation.

For the middle primary levels, the **Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)** programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support low progress learners students using intervention strategies and models that are guided by research to tackle the 4 key issues: learning gaps, language, motivation and memory. The lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.

	<h5><a id="home">Use of Games in Mathematics (P1 to P6)</a></h5>
	
Through the use of games, we strive to nurture students’ creative and inventive thinking. Games provide the opportunity for students to apply their reasoning in a fun and inviting environment, where learning through engagement is promoted. 

Embedding games into the concrete-pictorial-abstract approach in Mathematics is purposeful, as students actively reinforce and hone their factual fluency and mathematical concepts. Also, games call for the need for our students to think out of the box as they devise creative and innovative solutions in the gameplay. Some examples of the games used during curriculum time are listed below.

			<h6> P1 AND P2 EXPERIENTAL LEARNING</h6>
			In the lower primary, students are equipped with a learning kit that focuses on helping students strengthen their numeracy skills – focusing on numbers and the four operations (+, -, x, ÷), applying these to solving word problem types, as well as allowing them to explore math even out of the classroom – from measurement topics to reinforcing numeracy skills that they learnt in school. Students use the learning aids in this kit to help them in improving their working memory. Here are some of the learning items in the learning kit: Digit Cards, Ten Frames, Clocks with adjustable hands and Measuring Tape

			<h6>LEARNING SUPPORT FOR MATHEMATICS (LSM)</h6>
			The LSM programme is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 Mathematics curriculum. Identified students will be supported by Math Teachers especially trained in LSM Teachers. In LSM classrooms, students experience the joy of learning through activity-based lessons focusing on small successes to build on their motivation.

###### P3 AND P4 EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING

Since the 2021 CATalytics Project with SEAB research team, students learn through a series of lessons which involved procuring and customising day-to-day items (eg: 1 kg of rice, 650 g of flour, 1 kg 400 g of red beans, etc) and setting up learning stations in the hall, taking into much consideration prevailing SMM requirements. All students of varying academic progress benefit very much from the experiential and authentic hands-on experiences on the topic Measurement, especially the sub-topic Mass. The students’ learning experiences increase their motivation to explore real life objects, and heighten the relevance of Math to everyday activities.

The ICAN programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support low progress learners students using intervention strategies and models that are guided by research to tackle the 4 key issues of learning gaps, language, motivation and memory. The lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.

<h5><a id="menu3">P5 to P6 Programmes</a></h5>

###### MATHEMATICS OLYMPIAD TRAINING PROGRAMME

In line with the school’s continual emphasis on enriching and developing students’ potential to their fullest, identified students from P5 and P6 will go through the training programme to be equipped with the necessary Mathematical knowledge and repertoire of problem-solving and visual-thinking skills to tackle higher-order and non-routine problems. Some of the competitions these students will take part include:

*   Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO)
*   Primary School Mathematics Challenge (PSMC)
*   National Mathematical Olympiad Singapore (NMOS)

###### ASPIRE PROGRAMME  

Every year, the P5 and P6 level will attend a problem solving workshop targeting on the areas of concerns for the respective levels. The course focuses on mathematical problems solving with emphasis on the development of concepts, skills and its underlying processes. In the process, the students will also be engaged in developing and using good thinking habits to approach problem solving and to evaluate their solutions. They will be guided to be aware of their metacognition, to think flexibly, to strive for accuracy and to manage their impulsivity.

</div>
<p>Students undergo basic photography training during Art lessons and follow
up with English lessons to acquire the language skills to describe the
photographs they have taken. Students learn to use language to represent
their photographs taken and eventually use this skill to raise awareness
of environmental and social issues within the community.</p>
<h3><strong>STELLAR</strong></h3>
<p>The STELLAR framework guides the teaching and learning of English language
in seeking to develop students’ listening, speaking, reading and writing
competencies. Apart from developing students who love reading and have
a strong foundation in English Language, we also develop multiple competencies
in our students to capitalise on the rich opportunities of the digital
age. Language is taught in meaningful contexts, through integrating the
different areas of language learning and introducing language skills and
strategies in an explicit and systematic way.</p>

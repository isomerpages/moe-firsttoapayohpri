### Stellar

The STELLAR framework guides the teaching and learning of English language in seeking to develop students listening, speaking, reading and writing competencies.

#### Lower Primary
<br>
Students experience the Shared Book Approach, Modified Language Experience (MLEA) writing and Learning Centres to learn skills related to “learning to read”, writing, speaking and listening.

#### Upper Primary
<br>
Students are taught progressive skills of Sustained Silent Reading, Supported Reading, KWL and Retelling and language activities. They engage in the Writing Process Cycle where they read, write and rewrite drafts in exploring language use. Learning takes place through differentiated instruction.

### Programmes

#### Speaking Programmes

The STELLAR framework guides the teaching and learning of English language in seeking to develop students listening, speaking, reading and writing competencies.

**Speaking Programmes**: Students develop confidence in speaking through a spiral approach to cultivating appropriate intonation, expression and pronunciation. 

##### Lower Primary (P1 and P2)

**Show and Tell**

Students talk about an artefact they bring to school with their classmates and answer questions raised by them.

##### Middle Primary (P3 and P4)

**One Minute of Fame**

Students are given the opportunity to present on a topic of their interest or passion to their classmates.

##### Upper Primary (P5 and P6)

**Seek and Speak**

Students develop confidence in speaking face to face with an adult by engaging a teacher in a conversation on a topic of their choice. 

#### Literacy Through Photojournalism

Students engage in discussion on photographs taken by peers in this unique programme. Through the thinking routine ‘I SEE, I THINK, I WONDER’, students learn to articulate their observations of the shot composition, the emotions the photograph portrays, and their opinions on environmental messages and issues captured in the shots. Students undergo basic photography training during Art lessons and follow up with English lessons to acquire the language skills to talk about the photographs. They will eventually use these skills to compose their photojournal to share their message with their audience.

#### Speech and Drama

This programme is aligned to MOE’s Curriculum C2015 initiatives to develop confident pupils and the Primary Education Review & Implementation (PERI) recommendation to use engaging teaching pedagogies. All P1 & P2 students undergo 12 sessions of drama training in preparation for the Drama Extravaganza held twice a year. Be sure to catch them in action!

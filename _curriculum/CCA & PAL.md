##### Co-curricular Activities (CCA)  

The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood.  
  
<b>CCAs are built into the school curriculum and it is conducted every Friday from <u>7.30am to 9.00am</u></b>.

##### CCA Experience  

All P3 students will go through a CCA experience programme, where they will experience 3 sessions on a specific CCA of their choosing in the 4 different CCA domains. After going through a full year of the experience, they will make a decision on the CCA they would like to join in 2021 as a P4 student.&nbsp;This would provide students with a clearer picture of what the different CCAs have to offer so that they would be able to make an informed decision together with their parents when choosing their CCAs.

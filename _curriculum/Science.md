Teaching and Learning of Science in FTPPS is done through an Inquiry approach, which involves questioning, gathering and making sense of evidence, and using it to justify answers. 

In practice, a ‘5E’ approach is also used, where teachers ‘**Engage**’ students to determine their prior knowledge on a particular topic, ‘**Explore**’ the topic with students through common hands-on experiences, ‘**Explain**’ concepts that were observed when students were exploring, ‘**Elaborate**’ on these concepts and link them together, and then ‘**Evaluate**’ students’ understanding. 

#### Support Lessons  

These lessons (a) reinforce students’ understanding of Science concepts, (b) strengthen the links between concepts learnt in the various topics and real-world applications, and (c) provide students with practice in answering questions.

In these lessons, students receive extra opportunities for hands-on activities with Science equipment and resources, as well as skills-based revision by question type.

#### Stretch Lessons

These lessons aim to stretch able students by extending what they have learnt in the classroom to different situations, as well as providing them with hands-on experiences with tinkering and experimental procedure. Lessons are planned to coincide with and build on students’ classroom learning, but also requiring higher-order and out-of-the-box thinking. In 2017, the P3 classes made use of Strawbees kits to create structures, while the P4 classes conducted Kitchen Science investigations.

##### Science Around Us

Students are encouraged to see the role of Science in their everyday lives through learning spaces throughout the school. Science murals can be found in high-traffic areas, and the biodiversity in school has been increased so students get to observe a variety of plants and animals up close. Labels have been created for the plants around the school, to provide students with relevant and interesting information.

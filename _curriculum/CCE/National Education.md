In First Toa Payoh Primary School, the school approach NE through an experiential approach by engaging the Heads, Hearts and Hands of our students and staff.

##### Engaging Heads – Know, Think and Understand

In engaging the “Head”, students actively involved in the learning of Singapore story and explicit teaching of the NE messages is seen through the integration of NE in the various lessons and commemoration of NE events.&nbsp;

The sharing of current affairs is another avenue to share the messages and seized teachable moments. NE wall in school and educational resources help to reinforce the messages and lessons learnt.

##### Engaging Hearts – Love, Appreciate and Belong

In engaging the “Heart”, students connect emotionally with the Singapore story, develop love for their nation and cultivate a sense of belonging and rootedness to Singapore. This is done so through various platforms such as NE learning journeys, attending Chingay and NE shows, commemorating the four core NE events and celebrating the four ethnic festivals.&nbsp;

Being in a school, which is culturally diverse, there are more opportunities for celebrating and appreciating the cultural differences among the students. Engaging in internationalisation programme by sending our students overseas and hosting groups of overseas students help to strengthen the cultural ties of Singapore.

##### Engaging Hands – Contribute, Create and Lead

In engaging the “Hand”, our students are given the opportunities to contribute to the community. Through the different Values-In-Action projects, students plan and decide on ways to show care and love to the school, community and the environment.  

#### Programmes

The school's approach to Character Education is aligned to the Social Studies Syllabus. The Social Studies curriculum aims to prepare our students to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they love in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience.  

Tagging on the students’ social life and experiences, Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, the thematic-based curriculum helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding of these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills and appreciate multiple perspectives.

Social Studies seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of values that define the Singapore society and nurture dispositions to show concern for the world they live in and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.

The curriculum therefore envisions the Social Studies student as an informed, concerned and participative citizen who is competent in quality decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly in the world he/she lives in.&nbsp;

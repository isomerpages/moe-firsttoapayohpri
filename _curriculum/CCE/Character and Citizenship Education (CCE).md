With CCE 2021, we aim to develop in our students:
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
	<li><strong>Good character:</strong><dt> Have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence</dt></li><br>
	<li><strong>Resilience and social-emotional well-being:</strong><dt> Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation</dt></li><br>
	<li><strong>Future readiness: </strong><dt> Have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence.</dt></li><br>
		<li><strong>Active citizenship: </strong><dt>Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others, and building a future for our nation.</dt></li>
</ol>
<br>
Character and Citizenship Education involves addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions. This is done in tandem with establishing a caring and enabling school environment where students’ well-being and learning are cared for and supported by teachers and peers. <br>

<h5><b><strong>Value of the Month / Focus of the Week</strong></b></h5>
Anchored by the school values and concepts in The Leader In the Me (TLIM), Value of the Month/Focus of the Week articulates and provides a focus for the teaching and learning of values and social-emotional skills across the curriculum. Students present Focus of the Week to the school through stories and role-play every month.

<h5><b><strong>Social Skills</strong></b></h5>
Key social skills are highlighted and explicitly taught to provide a common language in addressing teacher-student relations, peer relations and discipline in the school. By taking a positive and proactive approach, students learn skills and replacement behaviour which are important in developing life-long social and emotional competence.

With CCE 2021, we aim to develop in our students:
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
	<li><strong>Good character:</strong><dt> Have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence</dt></li><br>
	<li><strong>Resilience and social-emotional well-being:</strong><dt> Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation</dt></li><br>
	<li><strong>Future readiness: </strong><dt> Have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence.</dt></li><br>
		<li><strong>Active citizenship: </strong><dt>Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others, and building a future for our nation.</dt></li>
</ol>
<br>
Character and Citizenship Education involves addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions. This is done in tandem with establishing a caring and enabling school environment where students’ well-being and learning are cared for and supported by teachers and peers. <br>

<h4><b>Programmes</b></h4>

<h5><b>Values-In-Action Programme</b></h5>

Through our Values-in-Action (VIA)&nbsp;programme, we strive to&nbsp;engage our students in authentic experiences and to enable them reflect and learn. Leveraging the expanding environment approach to maximise learning impact, the&nbsp;programme&nbsp;allows students to learn progressively from first contributing to their homes, then to the school, and finally to the community and beyond.

<h5><b>Let's Clean Up! Programme</b></h5>
  
In a bid to instil the value of personal responsibility in our students, the school has embarked on the “**Let’s Clean Up!**’ Programme. Every day, the students will take part in a cleaning routine simultaneously. They also assume the personal responsibility of keeping their classroom and canteen areas clean and to take ownership to clear up after use.

<h4><b>Accessibility to Books</b></h4>

<b>Molly Bus (A collaboration with National Library Board)</b>
![Molly Bus](/images/Curriculum/Media%20Resource%20Library/molly%20bus%20logo.png)
Every year, Molly Bus by NLB will visit FTPPS. Students get a chance to have a glimpse of various book genres found in the national libraries. 

<b>Class Bulk Loan</b>
<br>
Every class has a class library consisting of a bulk loan from the school library for students to have access to books in class and to read during Pre-assembly Silent Reading time or during reading periods.

<b>Read and Response Books</b>
<br>
Students will read the same titled book in class. Thereafter, students will respond to their teachers’ questions and participate in the post-reading activities.

<b>Story Spark Programme</b>
<br>
The Story Spark Programme aims to develop a joy of independent reading among students using e-books. The programme provides levelled readers, which match students’ reading ability, for them to enjoy at their own time and pace. 

<b>Library Period</b>
<br>
P1 to P3 students are scheduled to go to the library once a week to either borrow books or have reading-related activities in the library. English periods are scheduled during the odd weeks and Mother Tongue periods are scheduled during even weeks.

<h5><b>Promoting the Library</b></h5>

<b>Monthly Library Activities</b>
<br>
Every year, interesting themes are lined up in conjunction with National Education core events (e.g. Total Defence Day, National Day etc.) or popular genres for monthly library activities. There will be thematic book displays, competitions, games and book-related activities held at the KIP Hub during recess. Students stand to win attractive prizes for the game or competition they participate in! An all-time favourite game includes the Kahoot! Game on “Know Your Library”. The top three scorers who managed to answer the questions correctly (and quickly!) will be the winners of the game.

<b>Book Display</b>
<br>
Book displays based on various themes or featured authors will be put up at the KIP Hub at least once a month. Based on the popular themes or featured authors, students are encouraged to pick up the books on display to read or borrow.

<b>Audio Stories</b>
<br>
During recess, audio stories would also be played for students to listen to and enjoy. This is to encourage reluctant readers to enjoy reading and eventually cultivate the love for reading.

<h5><b>Developing Student Librarians</b></h5>

Our student librarians are equipped with the leadership skills to promote the love for reading and assist their English teachers to build a reading culture in class. 

Student librarians play an active role in promoting the facilities of the KIP Hub, as well as the love for reading through book readings and sharing of their favourite reads. The videos below show our librarians in action. Enjoy!

Our student librarians promote the love of reading by sharing their book reviews on Ipads. They also go on an annual Learning Journey to an external library.

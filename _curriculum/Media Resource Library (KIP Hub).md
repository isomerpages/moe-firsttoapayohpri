**Class Bulk Loan**
<br>
Every class is given a library class bulk loan for students to have access to books in class and to read the books during the Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading programme.

**Read and Response Books**
<br>
Every class will read the same titled book and all the students will be able to respond to the teachers’ questions and participate in the post-reading activities.

**Library Period**
<br>
The P1 to P3 students are scheduled to go to the library once a week to either borrow books or have reading-related activities in the library. English periods are scheduled during the even weeks and Mother Tongue periods are scheduled during the odd weeks.

##### Promoting the Library 

**Monthly Library Activities**
<br>
Every year, interesting themes are lined up in conjunction with NE Core Events or popular genres. During these CIVICA Library activities there are thematic book displays, competitions, games and book-related activities during recess. Prizes are given out monthly! One of their favourite games is the Amazing Race where students look for the books once given their call numbers. The first group to match the books with the call numbers will be declared the winner.

**Audio Stories**
<br>
Every Thursday, during recess, audio stories would be played for students to listen and enjoy. This is to encourage our reluctant readers to enjoy reading and eventually cultivate a love for reading.

##### Developing Student Librarians

Workshops are conducted to equip our student librarians with the leadership skills to promote the love of reading in class and assist their English teachers to build a reading culture in class. They are also scheduled to help out at the school library during recess.

Student librarians will also share stories during recess and play an active role in promoting the love of reading.

Our student librarians promote the love of reading by sharing their book reviews on Ipads. They also go on an annual Learning Journey to an external library.

<h4><b>The EdTech Learning Experience</b></h4>

Aligned to MOE’s EdTech Plan, the infusion of ICT in daily lessons serves to help our students become future-ready digital learners who are self-directed, connected and collaborative.

The ICT department works closely with the other departments in the school to leverage on ICT to encourage ownership of learning in our students and to facilitate extension of our students’ learning. Online platforms like the Student Learning Space (SLS) is leveraged on to encourage discussion and reflection.

<h4><b> Cyber Wellness </b></h4>

At FTPPS, we recognise that cyber wellness is a critical part of education with the pervasive use of the world wide web. 

As such, cyber wellness topics were mapped out for the different levels and aligned to the school’s CCE FTGP lessons. We also seek to raise awareness on issues pertaining to cyber wellness through talks, workshops and training of our cyber wellness monitors.

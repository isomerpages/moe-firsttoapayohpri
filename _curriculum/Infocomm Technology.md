#### Learning Approach

##### 21st Century Competencies and Baseline ICT Skills

The infusion of ICT in daily lessons serves to help our pupils become self-directed and collaborative learners. It is aligned to the 21st century competencies and baseline ICT skills highlighted by MOE.

The ICT department works closely with the other departments in the school to leverage on ICT to encourage ownership of learning in our pupils and to facilitate extension of our pupils’ learning.

Our pupils are taught basic ICT skills like the use of word processors and data-capturing devices. They are also introduced to different tools and devices such as iPads and cameras to manage and extend their learning. Online platforms like the Student Learning Space (SLS) is leveraged on to encourage discussion and reflection.

#### Programmes

##### Cyber Wellness

At FTPPS, we recognise that cyber wellness has become a critical part of education with the pervasive use of the Internet. 

As such, cyber wellness topics were mapped out for the different levels and aligned to the school's FTGP lessons and Sexuality Education. We also seek to raise awareness on issues pertaining to cyber wellness through talks, workshops and training of our cyber wellness monitors.

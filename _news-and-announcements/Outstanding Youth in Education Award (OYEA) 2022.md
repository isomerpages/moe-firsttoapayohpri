The Outstanding Youth in Education Award gives national recognition to young teachers who are role models for the teaching profession. These educators motivate, challenge and inspire their students to realise their full potential. They personify deep passion for teaching, youthful idealism, energy and enthusiasm, and play a critical role in moulding the future of our nation.

The Nomination Form ([https://go.gov.sg/oyea2022](https://go.gov.sg/oyea2022)) can be accessed via Parents Gateway.  The closing date for the nominations for OYEA is 12 January 2022.

The Caring Teacher Awards (CTA) are aimed at acknowledging and rewarding those teachers in our schools who show care and concern for the holistic development of their students and go the extra mile to ensure their charges grow up to be confident and independent learners.

  
Nominees for the awards should fulfill the following criteria:

1.   Be a full-time teacher in a primary school, a secondary school or junior college/centralised institute in Singapore;

2.   Possess at least three years of teaching experience in Singapore; and

3.   Demonstrate exemplary character, initiative, integrity, altruism and a proven record of service to their schools and students.

While demonstration of good teaching practices and the ability to deliver excellent examination results are part of the selection criteria, the emphasis of the awards is on the humanistic qualities of the teaching profession.
